# Akshay's dotfiles

## Installation

You can clone the repository wherever you want. I usually just clone it to my home directory. The symlinks script will make symbolic links to the dotfiles configured and residing in the folder into the home directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshaysth/dotfiles && cd dotfiles && ./makesymlinks.sh
````
