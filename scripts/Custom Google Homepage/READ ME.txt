HOW TO CHANGE YOUR BROWSERS HOMEPAGE:

1. follow instructions given from this website:   http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000577.htm

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO CHANGE THE BACKGROUND:

1. First find an image you want to use. I recommend using desktop wallpapers because they will fit 
the full window without the awkward tile effect. Try searching http://www.goodfon.su/
2. When you find an image online, right click > copy image URL
3. If your using an image that is already saved onto your computer, copy the direct file path which 
should start from your harddrive and end with a .jpg or .png 
for example:   C:\Users\Jlynn\Documents\Custom Google\Images\2560x1600.jpg
4. In the Custom Google Homepage folder, find the file that says 'Stylesheet' and open it in a notepad!
5. Find the 2nd line that says:   background:url(Images/1920x1200.jpg)
6. Paste either the image URL link or file path between the parenthesis, then save and refresh your
browser homepage.

* Using lower quality or smaller images will decrease the load time of the background.
